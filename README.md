# SI507-final-project
This is a final Project for SI507, a python class. The whole project is about finding hotels and restaurants at the place where you want to go.  

# How to play with program
Users can simply answer the question asked by the computer. After answer a few questions, the computer will generate a serie of results that user can review. For the restaurant, users can check further information about the restaurant's information, such as full name, whether closed or not, rating, address, and phone number. For the hotel section, users still need to answer a few question to narrow down the results. 

# Special instructions for running code
I've already add the API key in the code. So, users can run the code on their own computer by using my API key. 

# Python packages
I use requests to require the access from API. And use JSON module to read the JSON file.
